# Checkboxes
```markdown
- [ ] Task not yet done
- [x] Task completed
```

How to interact with the checkboxes

In **Preview Mode** or **Live Preview**, you can just **click the checkbox** to toggle:

- `[ ]` ➜ `[x]` ✅ (done)
    
- `[x]` ➜ `[ ]` ⬜ (not done again)
    

No need to manually type the `x` each time.
