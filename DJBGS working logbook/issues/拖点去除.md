- [x] find the inputs and outputs of the 拖点去除函数
- [x] compare the extrinsic and intrinsic matrix in the fastlivo 
- [x] compare the RS_LOAD.YAML in the fastlivo and fastlivo2
- [x]  analyze the internal logic of the function
- [x] try to adjust the params in the yaml


issue： the tailing points cannot be removed completely
potential reasons:
- [x] The params in the RS_LOAM.yaml does not be adjusted successfully
- [x] The vio functions in the rs ac1 fastlivo do not add into the fastlivo2
- [x] The ac1.yaml's params are not optimized
- [x] The tailing points remove in the fastlivo ac1 is not suitable in the fastlivo2 ac1

- [x] what are the 1,2,4,6 means
```cpp
for (int i = iter_lower; i < iter_upper; ++i) {

if (segmentedCloud->points[i].intensity == 1) {

FA_res.outlierCloud.points.push_back(segmentedCloud->points[i]);

} else if (segmentedCloud->points[i].intensity == 2 ||

segmentedCloud->points[i].intensity == 4 ||

segmentedCloud->points[i].intensity == 6) {

FA_res.validCloud.points.push_back(segmentedCloud->points[i]);

FA_res.outlierCloud.points.push_back(segmentedCloud->points[i]);

} else {
```


current issue
- [x] the vio may not use the filtered points, causing the filtering is not clear
find the input point cloud for the vio system, change them to the filtered point cloud.
