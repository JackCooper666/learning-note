list consists of nodes
# single direction list
node consist of its data and a pointer pointing to the address of the next node.

the advantages of the the list is that:
1. user can insert or delete nodes at any position

the disadvantages of the list is that:
1. the traversal speed is slower than the that of the array
2. space consumption is larger than that of the array

# the list in the STL
The STL's list is bio-direction list.
The node of it consists of three things: the data, the next pointer pointing to the address of the next node, the previous pointer pointing to the address of the previous node.

`push_front()`: push node at the top
`pop_front()`: 
`push_back()`: push node at the end
