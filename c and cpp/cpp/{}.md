The `{}` in the line:
```cpp
int light_max{0};
```
are used for **brace (uniform) initialization**, also known as **list initialization**, introduced in **C++11**.
# ‚úÖ Meaning:
This initializes `light_max` to `0` ‚Äî just like `int light_max = 0;`.
But the **brace syntax `{}`** has some **advantages and special behavior**:

# üß† Why use `{}`?

1. **Prevents narrowing conversions**:
```cpp
int a{3.14}; // ‚ùå Error! Narrowing from double to int
int b = 3.14; // ‚úÖ Compiles, but truncates to 3 silently
```
1. **Works with class constructors uniformly**:
```cpp

```
1. **Unifies syntax for all types**:
	- Primitives: `int x{5};`
	- Classes: `MyClass obj{arg1, arg2};`
	- Aggregates: `struct S {int a; int b;}; S s{1, 2};`
