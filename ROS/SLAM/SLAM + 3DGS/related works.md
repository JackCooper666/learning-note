# Gaussian-lic
key steps:
1. initialization of gaussian map
	The photo-realistic Gaussian map is bootstrapped with all 3D points of the first received frame.
2. expansion the gaussian map
	Every frame after the first usually captures the geometry and appearance of the newly observed areas. However, LiDAR points from different frames may contain duplicate information. We take every fifth frame as a keyframe. When a keyframe is received, we first merge all points received in these five frames into a point cloud. To avoid redundancy, we then render O from the current keyframe image view according to Î±-blending.
3. optimize the gaussian map
	Once the current received frame is a keyframe, we randomly select K keyframes from all keyframes to optimize the Gaussian map, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problems and maintaining the geometric consistency of the global map. We randomly shuffle the selected K keyframes and iterate through each of them to optimize the map by minimizing re-rendering loss:
